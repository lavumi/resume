### Introduction
Starting with game client development, I am a curious developer who has ventured into various fields such as rendering, real-time game servers, web servers, and more.

My main responsibility is server development, and currently, at my company, I am also in charge of tasks such as building and operating internal server environments, including test servers, Redmine, Wiki, Homepage, and more.

Lately, I have been drawn to Go and Rust, and I am studying and working on personal projects in both languages.
